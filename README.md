# Wordpress Theme Starter kit.

I'm trying to make it maximum seo-ready. Comments are welcome. Enjoy!


Usage of that is pretty simple:
- install Wordpress to your hosting
- clone this to some folder inside /wp-content/themes (i.e. /wp-content/themes/theme)
- activate that blank theme in admin panel
- now you can easily add extra front-end for pages (add Page in admin with some slug, create page-some-slug.php in theme folder. Your page will displayed with such front-end).


# Why did you do that?
I wanted fast and simple starter kit. Here it is.

I almost always don't need tags/author/date pages, so i disable'em in functions.php.
